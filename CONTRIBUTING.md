# Contributing to Gini iOS SDK

## Pull Requests

We are happy to include pull requests to improve the usability of the Gini iOS SDK.

This is our workflow:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from master.
2. Alongside your code add tests (using Kiwi) and proper documentation (Javadoc-Style).
3. Make sure all tests pass.
4. Make a pull request.


## Coding Guidelines

* Use the exising code to see how we do things
* Use new-style literals


## License
