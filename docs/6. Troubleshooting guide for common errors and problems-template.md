OAuth Error: Invalid Client
---------------------------

Problem description
===================

You successfully created an instance and try to log in the user. The web browser opens the page with the Gini user center
but after you've logged in successfully, there's an error page which has the following content:

    
    OAuth Error
    
    error="invalid_client", error_description="Bad client credentials"



Solutions
=========

This problem is caused by several errors:

- You did not register your app with Gini. 
  [See the Gini API documentation to find out how to register your app with Gini](http://developer.gini.net/gini-api/html/guides/oauth2.html#first-of-all-register-your-application-with-gini)

- You misspelled your client id when calling the SDK's factory method. Please ensure that there are no spelling errors
  in your method call and that you did not mix-up the arguments.

- You try to use a client id which was only registered for the sandbox environment on the production environment.
  [See the Integration Guide on how to configure the SDK to use the sandbox environment](1.%20Integration%20Guide.html)
