Swift Integration Guide
-----------------------

You can easily use the Gini iOS SDK without any limitation in applications you built with Apple's new Swift programming
language.

In order to use the Gini SDK in Swift code, you first need to add a bridge header file. A good tutorial how to add a
bridge header file can be found at [Medium](https://medium.com/@stigi/swift-cocoapods-da09d8ba6dd2).

Inside the bridging header, you must import the Gini SDK by adding the following line:

    #import <Gini-iOS-SDK/GiniSDK.h>

After that, you can use all Gini classes inside your Swift code. See the [integration guide](docs/1.%20Integration%20Guide.html)
for details how to integrate the Gini iOS SDK into your app. The code examples are in Objective-C but can be used in
Swift if you follow [Apple's interaction guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-XID_26).
