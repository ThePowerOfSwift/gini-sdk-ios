Upload an image and get extractions
-----------------------------------

The following guide is a short tutorial how to implement the most common task: Uploading an image to the Gini API and
getting the extractions for that document.

First of all, get the sdk instance that you previously added as a property of the app delegate: 

    GiniSDK *sdk = ((AppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]).giniSDK;
    
Afterwards, you can use the session manager instance to check if the user is already logged in by 

    [sdk.sessionManager getSession];

If the user is not logged in or if his access token has been expired and cannot be renewed thus requiring a new
authentication by the user, this task fails with an error and you must log in the user again:

    [[sdk.sessionManager getSession] continueWithBlock:^id(BFTask *sessionTask){
        if (sessionTask.error) {
            return [sdk.sessionManager login];
        }
        return task.result;
    }];

The result of this log in is a BFTask*. Since tasks are easy chainable, you can login the user (or reuse an existing
session) and afterwards upload the image:

    UIImage *image = myImage; // assuming that you already got an image, e.g. from the Gini Vision library.
    GINIDocumentTaskManager *manager = sdk.documentTaskManager;

    [[[sdk.sessionManager getSession] continueWithBlock:^id(BFTask *sessionTask){
        if (sessionTask.error) {
            return [sdk.sessionManager login];
        }
        return task.result;
    }] continueWithSuccessBlock:^id(BFTask *task){
        return [manager createDocumentWithFilename:@"newFile" fromImage:image];
    }];

Usually you want to do something with the created document:
 
    UIImage *image = myImage; // assuming that you already got an image, e.g. from the Gini Vision library.
    GINIDocumentTaskManager *manager = sdk.documentTaskManager;
    
    [[[[sdk.sessionManager getSession] continueWithBlock:^id(BFTask *sessionTask){
        if (sessionTask.error) {
            return [sdk.sessionManager login];
        }
        return task.result;
    }] continueWithSuccessBlock:^id(BFTask *task){
        return [manager createDocumentWithFilename:@"newFile" fromImage:image];
    }] continueWithSuccessBlock:^id(BFTask *createTask){
        GINIDocument *document = createTask.result;
        // Do something with the document
    }];

And of course you are usually interested in the document's extractions. Documents are created immediately when you
upload an image or PDF file to the Gini API, but the document's extractions are only available when the document has 
been fully processed. Because of that, the Gini iOS SDK provides a method to wait until the document is fully processed.
The processing state of a document is available as the `state` property of a `GINIDocument` instance.

    UIImage *image = myImage; // assuming that you already got an image, e.g. from the Gini Vision library.
    GINIDocumentTaskManager *manager = sdk.documentTaskManager;

    [[[[[sdk.sessionManager getSession] continueWithBlock:^id(BFTask *sessionTask){
        if (sessionTask.error) {
            return [sdk.sessionManager login];
        }
        return task.result;
    }] continueWithSuccessBlock:^id(BFTask *task){
        return [manager createDocumentWithFilename:@"newFile" fromImage:image];
    }] continueWithSuccessBlock:^id(BFTask *createTask){
        GINIDocument *document = createTask.result;
        // And the document has a property extractions, which is another task that resolves to the extractions:
        return document.extractions;
    }] continueWithSuccessBlock:^id(BFTask *extractionsTask){
        NSDictionary *extractions = task.result;
        NSLog(@"extractions: %@", extractions);
        return nil;
    }];
    
The extractions object is now a dictionary, where the keys are the specific extraction as documented at 
[Gini's API documentation](http://developer.gini.net/gini-api/html/document_extractions.html#available-specific-extractions) and the values are
corresponding `GINIExtraction` objects.

If you want to use the received extractions to update your application's user interface, make sure that you follow the
issues brought up in the [working with tasks programming guide](2.%20Working%20with%20tasks.html), especially the section
*Tasks and Threads / Queues*.
