Swift Integration Guide
=======================

If you follow this guide you can easily use the Gini iOS SDK in applications you built with Apple's Swift programming language.

We assume you have already integrated the Gini SDK into your project. If not, take a look at our :ref:`integration guide <guide-getting-started>`.

Module import
===============

In order to use the Gini SDK in Swift code, you have to import the Gini iOS SDK module in every file you want to use it.
Just add 

.. code-block:: swift

    import Gini_iOS_SDK

to the top of each file. After that, you can use all Gini classes inside your Swift code!
