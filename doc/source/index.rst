Gini iOS SDK Documentation
==============================

Introduction
------------

Gini provides an information extraction system for analyzing documents (e. g. invoices or
contracts), specifically information such as the document sender or the amount to pay in an invoice.

The Gini iOS SDK library encapsulates the Gini API and makes the integration into your app a
breeze. 

.. hint:: Code examples in this tutorial are in Objective-C but the Gini iOS SDK can easily be integrated in applications written in **Swift**. To learn more about it see the :ref:`notes on Swift <guide-swift>`.
