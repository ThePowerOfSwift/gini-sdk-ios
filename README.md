# Gini iOS SDK

An SDK for integrating Gini technology into other apps.


## Installation

For maximum convenience we rely on the excellent dependency manager [Cocoapods](http://www.cocoapods.org).
To install the Gini iOS SDK simply add the following repository to your Cocoapods installation

    $ pod repo add gini-podspecs git@github.com:gini/gini-podspecs.git

and include the pod in your Podfile

    pod 'Gini-iOS-SDK'

Then run
    
    $ pod install
    
in your project directory and open the generated Xcode workspace.


## Usage

Learn how to use the Gini API at the [Gini Developer Portal](http://developer.gini.net).
